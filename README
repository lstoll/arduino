This contains my arduino and processing sketchbooks.

Some of the code is mine, some collected from the internet. Credit given when 
taken off the net - if you find something here that is yours and I haven't 
linked back to it (or you don't want it here) please let me know.

ArduinoSketchbook/ - generic arduino sketchbook
- WiiChuckProcessedToSerial/ - an app from the net, that processed nunchuck data
								and outputs in on serial.
								see: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/WiiChuckClass
-	- WiiChuck.h - header that contains nunchuck functionality. may want to reuse
-	- WiiChuckProcessedToSerial.pde - the sketch itself


ProcessingSketchbook/ - generic processing sketchbook
- WiiChuckCube/WiiChuckCube.pde - app that will read data from the WiiChuckProcessedToSerial
									app on an arduino and map it to a cube.
