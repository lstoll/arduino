Plain Text Wiki Bundle Info
===========================

Usage
-----

* Create a new directory
* In TextMate, choose 'Create New Wiki' from the menu 
  Bundles > Plain Text Wiki
* Select your new directory. A file 'IndexPage.txt' will be created and opened
* Reference new pages using CamelCase or [[like this]]. Page names will appear 
  underlined
* To follow a link, put the text cursor over a page name and hit Enter (not 
  Return)

Return to the index page at any time: Type shift+ctrl+i

Insert a list of pages by typing 'pagelist' and hitting tab.


Export as HTML
--------------

Choose 'Export Wiki as HTML' from the Plain Text Wiki commands menu. You will 
be prompted for a directory where the Web pages will be saved (please make 
sure it's empty).

For converting text to HTML, Plain Text Wiki understands Markdown: 
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

To customise the HTML of the wiki, add wiki-styles.css to the project 
directory--it'll be copied to the export directory and included.

For more control, add wiki-header.html and wiki-footer.html to the project 
directory. Include the string "%s" in wiki-header.html to have that replaced 
with the page title on export.
