OneWire
=======

Simple interfacing protocol. The [[DS1820]] uses it, so its worth looking there for usage examples.

The library in use here can be found in  [[arduino-libraries.git]]

Create a OneWire object to work with
------------------------------------

	OneWire ds(<port number>);
		
Will create a instance (ds) of the OneWire interface on the passed in port number.
Call this for communication to the device.

Addressing (inc. library call)
------------------------------
On the bus, a call to the search ROM command (0xF0) will allow the retrieval
of the addresses of the devices on the bus (very simplified, see the data 
sheet and OneWire library for more information). For at least the DS1820
(and possibly all OneWire devices - don't know) the device will respond with
64 of data. The least significant (first 8 bits) contain the family code, i.e
the type of device this is (multiple types of device can be on a single bus)
the next 48 bits contain the unique device serial number - this can be used 
to identify the exact device this is (useful when multiple devices from the
same family are on the bus).

Using in the library the OneWire library - 

	// this will scan the bus until a device is found, and put its address
	// into the byte array addr[] addr[0] is the family code, addr[1]-[6]
	// is the unique device serial, and return true. If no device is found
	// it will return false. Each time you call this, it will return the 
	// next device on the bus. Once no device is found, it will return false
	byte addr[8];
	bool deviceFoundOnBus(addr);
	
	// calling this will reset the search, and start again.
	ds.reset_search();
